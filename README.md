Commentary: 
  While it's a relatively simple program we had fun creating it, particularly learning how to implement audio within JavaScript. We hope     you like our take on Vision, simeltaneously bringing old technology together with new technology and easy-to-follow visuals for a language that is typically only audible. Thank you for checking out our project!
  
  Best,
